    <h2>News Regarding Game Demos</h2>
    <p>
      Posted on September 9, 2022 at 9:47 AM<br /><br />
      Hello! TheWalkingTaco here! I have some news regarding game demos. We are
      still trying to figure out a solution for the demo of The Mountain. We are
      unable to host the game in a website so it will have to be a downloadable
      game. I don't really like the idea of having to download a demo because it
      can conflict with the installation of the final game and you have to deal
      with installers and... it's just a mess. That's why I won't be able to
      publish frequent demos for The Mountain now that it's moved to RPG Maker
      VX Ace. We are also still in a very early development stage so it will be
      a while before you see a demo for The Mountain.<br />
      As for The Droid Project, we will embed the demo on our project page but
      we are still in a very early development stage for The Droid Project too
      so... yeah it's gonna be a while.
      <br />
      If you want to get a quick look at what The Mountain is going to be like,
      you can play the old version of the demo which is on itch.io. You can see
      a link on The Mountain's

      >. <br /><br />Until next time!<br /><br />TheWalkingTaco
