      <br />The Droid Project is a video game being made in EasyRPG and
      developed by Studio 403.
      <br />
      This game originally was an idea for a video game inspired by the Mother
      series that was being developed by another game studio. It originally had
      a lot of references to the Mother series. But the idea did not meet the
      vision that the director of that game studio wanted to achieve. But they
      said that I could turn it into my own game. So I looked over the story
      once more and decided to remove almost all the Mother references and
      create a new game of my own.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Droid Project is a game about:<br />
      Friends<br />Acceptance<br /><i>Depression</i><br />
      Robots<br />and most importantly... yourself.<br /><br />
      "I'm a totally normal kid! Yep! Nothing wrong with me! How do I know?<br />My
      father told me!"<br /><br />
      Studio 403 has yet to produce a demo version of this software as it is
      still in a very early development stage. See

      updates on our projects and games.
