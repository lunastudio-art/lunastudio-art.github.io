      Set in a virtual computer world that humanity migrated to after the
      destruction of Earth, a young man wakes up in a small cave. He has no idea
      who he is or why he is there. Play as Rodrik, a young man with a small gem
      which contains strange power, Maggie, a young lady who is sick of living
      in the conditions of her town, and Gavin, a smart young man who is
      determined to uncover a dark secret about the truth about their world.
      These three kids' stories are connected somehow. And as a dark shadow
      looms over their world, they must figure out who the enemy is and how to
      defeat it. This is not a normal enemy. Defeating it is simply impossible
      to do. At least for a normal person...

      The Mountain is an RPG being created in RPG Maker VX Ace and developed by
      Studio 403. It is still in a very early development stage. The Mountain
      had previously been developed in GB Studio but the limits of GB Studio
      made it difficult to produce a product that was like my original vision of
      the game. So I moved to RPG Maker VX Ace. Now I feel like I can achieve
      this dream game of mine and hopefully make it even better than my original
      vision!
